# Virtual Casino

The code is divided up into sections.

## Section 1: Front End

We are working to combine a pure JavaScript implementation and an implementation that uses Phaser, a popular game framework.

## Section 2: Integration Layer (Middle)

Nothing so far. We intend to use Node.js to connect to our database.

## Section 3: Back End

We've created several .sql files, which we will use to create a database in a VM. We will then use Node.js to connect the front end and the database.
