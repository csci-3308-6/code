INTEGRATION

- when user signs in there needs to be some sort of ID variable that is passed through: 
~ blackjack game for keeping track of cash
~ game room for color and shape of character 

- sign-in:
~ confirm user actually exists
~ set id variable ^^^

- character customization:
~ returning user insert/set display table (shape, color)
~ random play-now user gets temporary color/shape saved while they stay on the server

- blackjack stats: 
~ cash, games lost, games won, games played, net profit

- sign-up
~ insert: username, password
~ increment: user_id, display_id, stats_id


BACKEND
